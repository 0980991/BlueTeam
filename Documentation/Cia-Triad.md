# The CIA Triad
The CIA triad is a common model that forms the basis for the development of security systems.

The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is crucial to the operation of a business, and the CIA triad segments these three ideas into separate focal points.

## Confedentiality

Confidentiality revolves around safeguarding data from unauthorized access through strict access controls. It ensures that individuals are granted access only to the information they need for their role. Breaches in confidentiality may occur due to direct hacking attempts or human errors like disclosing passwords.

To enhance confidentiality, organizations can employ data classification, access control policies, encryption, and multi-factor authentication. Educating all members on recognizing and mitigating security risks is essential to uphold confidentiality.



## Integrity

Data integrity requires ensuring data authenticity and reliability to prevent tampering. Security breaches, either intentional or accidental, could lead to data falsification, impacting business credibility. Protecting data integrity involves utilizing hashing, encryption, digital signatures, and trustworthy certificate authorities.

Non-repudiation methods, such as digital signatures for emails, prevent individuals from denying sending or receiving information. Maintaining data integrity is crucial for upholding trust with stakeholders and defending against malicious attacks.

## Availability

Data availability is vital for operational efficiency, ensuring that authorized individuals access information when needed. Factors like power outages, natural disasters, or intentional attacks can compromise accessibility. Employing redundant networks, constant software upgrades, and robust disaster recovery strategies can enhance system availability, mitigating risks and ensuring seamless operations
