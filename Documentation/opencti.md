# OpenCTI

[OpenCTI's](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti) main objective is to create a comprehensive tool that allows users to capitalise on technical and non-technical information while developing relationships between each piece of information and its primary source. The platform can use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to structure the data. Additionally, it can be integrated with other threat intel tools such as MISP and TheHive.

It can be used via a web interface and refer to [this guide](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/usage/getting-started/) to get started.

OpenCTI can also be used in conjuction with Python by installing the OpenCTI python module

```bash
pip install OpenCTI
```
