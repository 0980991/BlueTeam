# Threat Intelligence Tools

[1. Urlscan.io](#urlscan.io)

Threat Intelligence is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to generate meaningful patterns on how to mitigate against potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats targeting organisations, industries, sectors or governments.

To mitigate against risks, we can start by trying to answer a few simple questions:

1. Who's attacking you?
2. What's their motivation?
3. What are their capabilities?
4. What artefacts and indicators of compromise should you look out for?

There exist different types of threat intel:
- Strategic Intel
- Technical Intel
- Tactical Intel
- Operational Intel

## Urlscan.io

## Abuse.ch

Abuse.ch is a research project hosted by the Institue for Cybersecurity and Engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. It was developed to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project. These platforms are:

_IOC: Indicator Of Compromise_

- [Malware Bazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/):  A resource for sharing malware samples.
- [Feodo Tracker](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/):  A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.
- [SSL Blacklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/):  A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.
- [URL Haus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/):  A resource for sharing malware distribution sites.
- [Threat Fox](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/):  A resource for sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).
